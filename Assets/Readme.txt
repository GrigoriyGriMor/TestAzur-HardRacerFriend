Dear Developers who use Cartoon Forest Pack!

- According to some comments of packaging of Cartoon Forest Pack, I re-packed the asset. As you can see, each object is exported as 1 file FBX seperatedly. I tried to keep same name for all prefabs that don't make you feel messy when re-import the asset.

- Apart from fixing the packaging, I updated 20 objects including banyan tree, palm trees and flowers. The fences are also attached to help you easily create your own environment.

- All wrong pivots are fixed and you can create forest in Unity Terrain

- Demo Scene is availble!!! 

- I also add a new shader which can help view double-side, react on light and receive shadows. You can come to Transparent Cutout/ Diffuse Double Side to see it.
Hope you see the quality of this asset better!
